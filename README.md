## What is PWA-Generator
The PWA Generator is an application I made to make it easier to generate the necessary components of a progressive web app. I think progressive web apps are incredibly useful, but making things like the web manifest or icons can be tedious. And so, this web application is a quick weekend project I made to automate this process and quickly get a PWA up and running.

## Getting Started
